LECHE FLAN

Ingredients:

9-12 egg yolks
2 cans evaporated milk
1 can condensed milk
1/4 cup sugar
2/3 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla


Preheat oven to 375F.

Caramel sauce:  Use two pans (oval or round pans 1.5 or 2-inches deep and about 9 inches or less in diameter), putting 1/3 cup brown sugar in each pan.  Melt sugar with 2 teaspoons water in each pan, removing lumps and making sure none of the sugar is dry (this will make it easier when heating it).  Working on one pan at a time, put pan over very low heat to caramelize the sugar (coating bottom of pan).  Keep tilting the pan several inches above the heat to avoid burning the sugar.  Remove from heat when it's just about boiling.  Leave aside to cool (the caramel will harden).

Combine milk with the white sugar in a mixing bowl.
Combine egg yolks with milk mixture.  DO NOT BEAT (avoid bubbles).
Add vanilla.
Pour or ladle mixture into pans.

Get a bigger pan (disposable aluminum turkey-size roasting pan is good) where you can fit both small pans that contain the custard mixture.  PUt enough water into the big pan so that when you put the smaller pans in it, the water will come about half-way up the sides of the smaller pans.  (Adding even more water will lengthen the cooking time.)  Put the smaller pans into the big pan.
Place pans carefully in oven.  Cook for around 50 minutes.
Flan is ready when a toothpick stuck in the middle comes out clean.  (If not, then check again after another 15 minutes.)
Remove from oven, and take small pans out of the bigger pan.
Let small pans cool before refrigerating.

To serve, run a knife along inside edge of pan, then cover with serving tray or pie pan.  Flip and let the flan fall out onto the tray (it may need some encouragement to get out).
